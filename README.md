# 5 Shopify Tips For New Store Owners [2022]

Are you a new store owner looking to get a leg-up on the competition? 

You probably want to start using a few strategies that help increase online retail sales. 

[Shopify email marketing](https://targetbay.com/blog/shopify-email-marketing-guide/) is one of the most accessible solutions for anyone looking to sell online. Here are five tips that may provide more traffic, conversions, and ultimately, more money.

### Add All Your Policies To The Footer

Put terms, conditions, and privacy policy in the website's footer, either as links or in a snippet of text. 

It is a simple way to ensure that every visitor sees this information and can easily navigate away from your site if they don't like what they're reading. It's also important for Google, which considers this kind of information to be part of the "quality" of your site.

It is essential to have customers in different countries or states because it's easier to keep track of what each country says about privacy and shipping. 

If the information isn't there, people might think that you're hiding something shady or not complying with local regulations.

### Update Your Product Inventory Monthly

If you sell products that can be out of stock, like clothing or furniture, it's essential to update your inventory regularly so customers know whether or not they can buy from you. 

If someone wants an item from your store but finds out it's out of stock, they might give up on buying from you altogether — or worse yet, go somewhere else where they'll find what they want immediately.

This tip is crucial if you sell products with a long lead time or are hard to find in physical stores. 

If you don't keep track of how many units of each item are left, customers will have no idea whether they'll get their order by Christmas or wait weeks longer than expected, leading to unhappy customers and bad reviews. 

### Promote On Free Channels If You Don't Have The Budget

There are several free channels where you can promote your Shopify store. If you don't have the budget to pay for ads, here are some of the best places to promote your store:

Start with blog posts. Blogs are one of the best ways to get traffic to your site, and blog posts about products can drive even more sales. 

Post on forums. Forums like Reddit and Quora can be powerful places to get exposure for your business if you post in the right areas.

Participate in social media groups. Social networks like Facebook groups can be another great place to share content, ask questions and engage with users that might be interested in what you sell on Shopify. 

### Always Test Your Store's Mobile Settings

There are plenty of great Shopify tips for new store owners, but one thing often gets overlooked.

That thing is testing your store's mobile settings.

As you know, most ecommerce sales are made on a mobile device. It's no longer enough to have a mobile-friendly website — if you want people to buy from your store, it needs to be optimized for mobile devices too! 

Most customers now search for products on their phones, so if yours isn't optimized for this device, they won't find what they want quickly and may leave your site altogether!

### Customize The Theme As Little As Possible

If you're starting, don't spend too much time worrying about the look and feel of your store.

Customize the theme as little as possible. You can always make changes later, but it's best to start with something close to what you want.

We recommend creating your theme if you're a beginner. It will help you learn how different elements work together and make the most out of Shopify's robust features.

For example, the best Shopify themes have built-in SEO and social sharing tools that help your website rank higher in search results. 

They also come with built-in payment processing, so you don't need to worry about setting up an account with PayPal or Stripe (or getting hacked).

### Conclusion

As Shopify continues to attract more merchants, the population of its customers is sure to increase. We've tried to offer advice that applies to both new and experienced shop owners, so we hope you find these tips helpful as you run your own online business.
